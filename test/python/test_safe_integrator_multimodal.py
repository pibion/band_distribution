"""
Regression test for integrate_g_safe_inspect with multimodal integrands.

The safe integrator scans the integrand on a grid, groups the non-zero
samples into peaks, pads each group's range, and integrates each range
with adaptive quadrature.  When two padded ranges overlap they must be
*merged* -- integrating both would double-count the overlap, and
discarding one (as an older version did) silently drops the mass of an
entire peak.

Each case integrates a sum of unit-normalized Gaussians, so the exact
answer is the number of peaks.  The narrow-sigma cases produce exact
zeros between the peaks (the exponential underflows), which is what
splits the scan into multiple groups.
