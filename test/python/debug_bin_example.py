"""
Example: inspect the integration of a single bin in isolation.

Use this when expected_counts_from_pdf reports a ~0 (or suspiciously
small) expected count for some bin and you need to see why -- run
chisquare_harness.debug_bin on just that bin instead of the full
n_bins loop. See debug_bin's docstring for what each of the three
reported numbers means.

Edit BIN and PARAMS below to match the case you're debugging, then run:
