Why scipy.integrate.quad can silently return ~0 for a narrow peak,
and how to fix it with the `points=` argument.

Background
----------
scipy.integrate.quad is *adaptive*: it starts from a fixed Gauss-Kronrod
sampling rule over the whole integration interval, compares two
polynomial-degree estimates, and only subdivides further where those
estimates disagree. That works great when the integrand is smooth on
the scale of the interval. But if your PDF is a narrow ridge/peak that
is much narrower than the interval, it's entirely possible for every
point in that initial sampling rule to land in the flat, ~0 region on
either side of the peak. In that case BOTH polynomial estimates agree
that the integral is ~0, quad reports a *tiny* error estimate (it has
no idea it missed anything), and it returns 0 instead of subdividing
toward the peak. This is the "quad returns something tiny/zero" failure
you're probably seeing on bins where the PDF ridge is narrow compared
to the bin.

The fix: `quad(f, a, b, points=[...])` tells quad to break [a, b] into
subintervals at the given points *before* starting the adaptive
search, and to refine each subinterval independently. If you tell it
roughly where the peak is (even just "peak center +/- N widths"), it's
guaranteed to place a subinterval around the peak and adaptively
refine inside it, rather than gambling on stumbling into it by luck.

This script demonstrates the failure and the fix in two steps:
  1. A single narrow 1D Gaussian in a wide interval (extreme, dramatic).
  2. A 2D case shaped like a real "integrate a PDF over a histogram
     bin" problem: a narrow ridge in y whose center y0(x) drifts with
     x, integrated with a nested quad(quad(...)) over an (x, y) box.
     This is the same technique used in this repo's
     python/chisquare_harness.py (see `inner_points_func`).

No threads, no external dependencies beyond numpy/scipy.
